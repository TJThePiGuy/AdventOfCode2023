# Day 2

Thank goodness I started earlier today, I was able to finish fourth in a private leaderboard.

## Part A

*Don't question list comprehensions.*

```python
import helper.aocdUtil as util

data = util.getData(day=2,year=2023).split('\n')

cumIdx = 0
for x,game in enumerate(data,1):
    trials = [_.split(', ') for _ in game.split(':')[1][1:].split('; ')]
    possible = True
    for trial in trials:
        draws = [_.split() for _ in trial]
        for draw in draws:
            count = int(draw[0])
            color = draw[1]
            if (color == 'red' and count >12) or (color=='green' and count>13) or (color=='blue' and count>14):
                possible = False
            if not possible:
                break
    if possible:
        cumIdx += x;

util.submit(cumIdx,2,2023,'a')
```

## Part B

Accidentally had "min" instead of "max" and was getting crazy small values. Changed it out and worked like a charm!
```python
import helper.aocdUtil as util

data = util.getData(day=2,year=2023).split('\n')

cumPower = 0
for x,game in enumerate(data,1):
    trials = [_.split(', ') for _ in game.split(':')[1][1:].split('; ')]
    red = -1;
    green = -1;
    blue = -1
    for trial in trials:
        draws = [_.split() for _ in trial]
        for draw in draws:
            count = int(draw[0])
            color = draw[1]
            if (color == 'red'):
                red = max(count, red)
            elif(color == 'green'):
                green = max(count, green)
            elif(color == 'blue'):
                blue = max(count, blue)
    cumPower += red*green*blue
util.submit(cumPower,2,2023,'b')
```
