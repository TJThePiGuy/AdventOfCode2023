# Day 1

## Part A

This one didn't take long, just a bit of a reminder of how Python and Regex works

```python
import regex
import aocd

day1 = aocd.get_data(day=1,year=2023).split()

total = 0
p = regex.compile(r'\d')
for line in day1:
    match = p.findall(line)
    total += int(match[0] + match[-1])

aocd.submit(total, day=1, year=2023, part='a')
```

## Part B

This part killed me, because I didn't realize that *there could be overlap* between the two different strings, i.e. ```eightwo3``` would count as ```8 2 3``` , not ```8 3``` . I just ran a brute-force-esque solution matching each possible character with either the number or the text of the number. Is it efficient? Probably not, but it's done.
```python
import helper.aocdUtil as util

day1 = util.getData(day=1,year=2023).split()
total2 = 0

numDict = {'one':1,'two':2,'three':3,'four':4,'five':5,'six':6,'seven':7,'eight':8,'nine':9,'zero':0}

for line in day1:

    y = ""
    for i in range(len(line)):
        if line[i] in "0123456789":
            y = y+line[i]
        else:
            for number in numDict.keys():
                if line[i:i+len(number)] == number:
                    y+= str(numDict.get(number));

    total2 += int(y[0]+y[-1])

util.submit(answer=total2,day=1,year=2023,part='b')
```
