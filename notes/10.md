# Day 10

## Part A

Turned out my original algorithm was flawed, ywt still got the correct answer. I'm just starting at the start, then going until all of the locations we should be visiting are already in the path. My algorithm is as follows:

1. Add the start to ```pointsToVisit```
2. For each point in ```pointsToVisit```, repeat the following:
    1. For each different direction, check if its valid. The direction is valid if it meets the following criteria:
        - The current tile "points" in that direction (or is the start)
        - The direction plus the current location is within the size of the data
        - The direction plus current location is not in ```pointsVisited```
        - The tile in the direction "points" in the proper direction
    2. If it meets the criteria, add the current point plus the direction to ```nextPoints```
    3. Add the current point to ```pointsVisited```
3. Copy ```nextPoints``` to ```pointsVisited```
4. If ```pointsVisited``` is not empty, jump back to Step 2

Just count the number of iterations, and we're vibing.

```python
import helper.aocdUtil as util

data = util.getData(10,2023,False).split('\n')
width = len(data[0])
height = len(data)

startPos = None
for y in range(height):
    for x in range(width):
        if data[y][x] == 'S':
            startPos = (x,y)

rules = [
    (1,0, '-J7', '-FLS'),
    (-1,0,'-FL', '-J7S'),
    (0,1, '|JL', '|F7S'),
    (0,-1,'|F7', '|JLS')]

pointsVisited = []
pointsToVisit = [startPos]
steps = 0
while(len(pointsToVisit) != 0):
    nextPoints = []
    for point in pointsToVisit:
        x,y = point
        currChar = data[y][x]
        for (dx,dy,endChars, startChars) in rules:
            if not(currChar in startChars) :
                continue
            if not(x+dx in range(width) and y+dy in range(height)):
                continue
            if (x+dx,y+dy) in pointsVisited:
                continue
            if data[y+dy][x+dx] in endChars:
                nextPoints.append((x+dx,y+dy))
        pointsVisited.append(point)
    pointsToVisit = nextPoints.copy()

    steps += 1
util.submit(steps-1,10,2023,'a')
```

## Part B

***AAAAAAAAAAAA***

It actually wasn't too bad. The most difficult part is, looking horizontally, where the outside begins and the inside ends. After taking 35 minutes to figure out that logic, the rest of the problem fell into place. 

```python
import helper.aocdUtil as util

data = util.getData(10,2023,False).split('\n')
width = len(data[0])
height = len(data)

startPos = None
for y in range(height):
    for x in range(width):
        if data[y][x] == 'S':
            startPos = (x,y)

rules = [
    (1,0, '-J7', '-FLS'),
    (-1,0,'-FL', '-J7S'),
    (0,1, '|JL', '|F7S'),
    (0,-1,'|F7', '|JLS')]

pointsVisited = []
pointsToVisit = [startPos]
while(len(pointsToVisit) != 0):
    nextPoints = []
    for point in pointsToVisit:
        x,y = point
        currChar = data[y][x]
        for (dx,dy,endChars, startChars) in rules:
            if not(currChar in startChars) :
                continue
            if not(x+dx in range(width) and y+dy in range(height)):
                continue
            if (x+dx,y+dy) in pointsVisited:
                continue
            if data[y+dy][x+dx] in endChars:
                nextPoints.append((x+dx,y+dy))
        pointsVisited.append(point)
    pointsToVisit = nextPoints.copy()

areaEnclosed = 0
for y in range(height):
    enclosed = False
    inWall = False
    wallChar = ''
    for x in range(width):
        currChar = data[y][x]
        if (x,y) in pointsVisited:
            if currChar in '|':
                enclosed = not enclosed
            elif data[y][x] in 'FL':
                inWall = True
                wallChar = currChar
            elif data[y][x] in '7J':
                inWall = False
                if (wallChar == 'F' and currChar == 'J') or (wallChar == 'L' and currChar == '7'):
                    enclosed = not enclosed
        else:
            areaEnclosed += int(enclosed)
util.submit(areaEnclosed, 10,2023,'b')
```
