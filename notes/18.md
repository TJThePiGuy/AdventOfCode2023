# Day 18

## Part A

This was a bit of a doozy, since I have a midterm at 8:30 AM and I need to sleep soon. Finding the path was the easy part. Getting the inner area was hard. I ended up using a floodfill on a point I knew for a fact was on the inside (which was the first space in the second row directly left of the first hashtag).
```python
from helper.aocdUtil import getData, submit

rawData = getData(18,2023,False)
directions:list[list[str]] = [_.split() for _ in rawData.split('\n')]

dirMap = {'U':(0,-1),'R':(1,0),'D':(0,1),'L':(-1,0)}

x=y=0

onPath = set()

onPath.add((x,y))

for line in directions:
    dir, dist, color = line
    dist = int(dist)
    dx,dy = dirMap[dir]
    for i in range(dist):
        x+= dx
        y+= dy
        onPath.add((x,y))
minX = min(x for x,y in onPath)
maxX = max(x for x,y in onPath)
minY = min(y for x,y in onPath)
maxY = max(y for x,y in onPath)

inPath = onPath.copy()
firstX = firstY = None

for y in range(minY+1, maxY+1):
    inFigure = False
    for x in range(minX, maxX):
        if ((x,y) in onPath) and ((x-1,y) not in onPath):
            inFigure = not inFigure
        if inFigure:
            firstX = x+1
            firstY = y
        if firstX != None:
            break
    if firstX != None:
        break

toCheck = [(firstX, firstY)]
checked = set((firstX, firstY))

while len(toCheck) > 0:
    x,y = toCheck.pop(0)
    if (x,y) in checked:
        continue
    checked.add((x,y))
    inPath.add((x,y))
    for dx,dy in [(-1,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1)]:
        if (x+dx, y+dy) not in inPath:
            toCheck.append((x+dx,y+dy)) 

submit(len(inPath),18,2023,'a')
```

## Part B

This one was much more difficult.

Instead of finding each individual point on the line, I ended up only finding the vertices. Then, the total area of the shape will be equal to half the perimeter plus the shoelace area of the shape with those vertices. 

```python
from helper.aocdUtil import getData, submit

rawData = getData(18, 2023)
directions: list[list[str]] = [_.split() for _ in rawData.split("\n")]

dirMap = {3: (0, -1), 0: (1, 0), 1: (0, 1), 2: (-1, 0)}

onPath: list = []

lineArea = 0

x = y = 0

for line in directions:
    dir, dist, color = line

    dir = int(color[-2])
    dist = int(color[2:-2], base=16)

    dx, dy = dirMap[dir]
    x += dx * dist
    y += dy * dist
    if dx < 0:
        lineArea += dist
    elif dy < 0:
        lineArea += dist
    onPath.append((x, y))

innerArea = 0

onPath.append(onPath[0])
for pt1, pt2 in zip(onPath[:-1], onPath[1:]):
    x1, y1 = pt1
    x2, y2 = pt2
    innerArea += (y1 + y2) * (x1 - x2)

submit(int(innerArea / 2 + lineArea) + 1, 18, 2023, "b")
```

## Part C???

I was curious how much more efficient my Part B algorithm was for the Part A data, so I tested it. (*Note: significantly more efficient*)

```python
from helper.aocdUtil import getData, submit

rawData = getData(18, 2023)
directions: list[list[str]] = [_.split() for _ in rawData.split("\n")]

dirMap = {"U": (0, -1), "R": (1, 0), "D": (0, 1), "L": (-1, 0)}

onPath: list = []

lineArea = 0

x = y = 0

for line in directions:
    dir, dist, color = line
    
    dist = int(dist)

    dx, dy = dirMap[dir]
    x += dx * dist
    y += dy * dist
    if dx < 0:
        lineArea += dist
    elif dy < 0:
        lineArea += dist
    onPath.append((x, y))

innerArea = 0

onPath.append(onPath[0])
for pt1, pt2 in zip(onPath[:-1], onPath[1:]):
    x1, y1 = pt1
    x2, y2 = pt2
    innerArea += (y1 + y2) * (x1 - x2)

submit(int(innerArea / 2 + lineArea) + 1, 18, 2023, "a")
```
