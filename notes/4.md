# Day 4

## Part A
This wasn't bad, just a bit annoying to parse. No regex, just straight ```split()```.

```python
import helper.aocdUtil as util

data = [_.split('|') for _ in util.getData(day=4,year=2023,save=False).split('\n')]

winnings = 0
for wins, mine in data:
    currWins = 0
    wins = wins.split(':')[1].split()
    mine = mine.split()
    for num in mine:
        if num in wins:
            if currWins == 0:
                currWins = 0.5
            currWins *= 2
    winnings += currWins
util.submit(winnings,4,2023,'a')
```
## Part 2
Not bad either, just needed to include a counter list. Things got weird with how I was adding certain values, but besides that, it was pretty easy.
```python
import helper.aocdUtil as util

data = [_.split('|') for _ in util.getData(day=4,year=2023,save=True).split('\n')]
cardCount = [1 for _ in data]

for idx, card in enumerate(data):

    wins = card[0].split(':')[1].split()
    mine = card[1].split()

    currWins = 0

    for num in mine:
        if num in wins:
            currWins += 1
    for jdx in range(1, currWins+1):
        cardCount[idx+jdx] += cardCount[idx]

util.submit(sum(cardCount),4,2023,'b')
```
